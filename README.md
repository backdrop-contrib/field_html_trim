Field HTML Trim
===============

Field HTML Trim adds settings to text field formatters (via the
[Field Formatter Settings](https://backdropcms.org/project/field_formatter_settings)
module) to allow trimming an HTML-enabled text field without counting HTML tags.

This means that you can make sure your trimmed text is always the correct
length, even when there's an image or other HTML content at the beginning of the
text.

Installation
------------

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules.

- Enable the 'HTML Trim' option on a text field formatter, then configure any
  other options as necessary.
