Field HTML Trim
===============

Field HTML Trim allows trimming an HTML-enabled text field without counting HTML
tags towards the character limit. This means that your trimmed text will be much
closer to the correct length, even when there's an image or other HTML content
at the beginning of the text.

Installation
------------

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules.

- Enable the 'HTML Trim' option on a text field formatter, then configure any
  other options as necessary.
